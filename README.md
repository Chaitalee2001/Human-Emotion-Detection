# Human Emotion Detection Using OpenCV and DeepFace

This project is a real-time human emotion detection system built using **OpenCV** for webcam streaming and **DeepFace** for emotion recognition. It uses a pre-trained deep learning model to detect human faces and classify their emotions in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time webcam emotion detection.
- Emotion classification using DeepFaceâ€™s pre-trained models.
- Displays the emotion detected (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.) on the video stream.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language for this project.
- **OpenCV**: Used for real-time webcam streaming and video frame processing.
- **DeepFace**: A deep learning framework used for emotion recognition.
- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework used to serve the real-time application.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend technologies for creating the user interface and handling webcam streaming.
